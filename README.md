## Introduction

### Dataset Description 
The data I've chosen comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Cashiers call in a check to the FBI or to other designated agencies to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase before they ring up the sale. In this way, people with a criminal background are less likely to purchase a gun.
* **The** [**NICS data**](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net%2Ftopher%2F2017%2FNovember%2F5a0a4db8_gun-data%2Fgun-data.xlsx)


  #### **Analytics Questions**
   * Q1 : What are Criminal Background Checks rate in each state?
   * Q2 : What is the trend of Criminal Background Checks for each type of firearms (Handgun, Long Gun, Other) in each state.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Investigating the Relationship Between Criminal Background Checks and Each State:
#### Analyzed the rate of criminal background checks across different states.

## Trend Analysis Over the Years:
### Analyzed the trend of background checks for each type of firearm across all states over the years.

## State-Specific Trend Analysis
### Investigated the trend of background checks for each type of firearm within individual states.

## Conclusions
### -Research Limitations:
* Limited Access to Information.
